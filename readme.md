# Twitter Clone

This is a **Twitter Clone** web application developed by me as a learning project. I followed a tutorial by **Codesistency** on YouTube and used their GitHub repository as a reference during development: [Codesistency Twitter Clone GitHub](https://github.com/burakorkmez/twitter-clone.git).  

> **Note:** I did not simply copy the project. I added several **new features** and improvements, including:
- **Search Users**: Search for users by username and navigate to their profile.
- **Delete Single Notification**: Users can delete individual notifications.
- **Strong Password Validation**: Passwords now require at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.

## Features

- User authentication (signup/login/logout)
- Follow/unfollow other users
- Create, like, and view posts
- Notifications system with read/unread tracking
- User search functionality
- Strong password enforcement
